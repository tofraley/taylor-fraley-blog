I took Monday and Tuesday off this week.  The weather was a mix of good and bad.  I managed to get some time outside on my bike, and even relaxed in the sun.  I definitely needed that.

I went into this long weekend with the plan to work on a side project and get some practice with Rust.  I spent most of Saturday, and maybe an hour of Sunday working through the book "Hands-On Microservices with Rust", and didn't work on my project at all.

I want to learn as much as I can, and as fast as I can.  But, learning hard things takes energy and focus.  Reading a book can be especially tricky. It's easy to feel like you are *doing* something, even when you aren't focused.  

Forcing myself to focus is usually pointless.  I expend even more energy while learning almost nothing.  After Sunday, I never made it back to the book.

It occurred to me I had formed some expectations.  I expected to make massive progress this weekend.  I also expected to keep it up over the next two or three weeks.  By that time, I expected to be "good" at Rust.

My brain didn't have a goal to work towards, so it was reading between the lines.  Like I said, I had planned  to work on my side project and maybe do some practice.  But I wasn't clear on why I was doing either.

Forming expectations is natural.  Create them thoughtfully, or you will create them thoughtlessly.   Set a goal, make a plan.  Be flexible and update the goal and the plan when you get more information.
